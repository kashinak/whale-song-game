## Design 

The game is designed to be fun and light-hearted to help engage the player in learning. The following design choices were made with this in mind: 

- ### Fonts

     -   The primary font **FishOutOfWater** was chosen for the game title because it has a fun cartoon-like water quality to fit the representation of whale's natural habitat. 

     -   The secondary font **Michroma** was chosen for the game controls, score board and game instructions because of its digital, futuristic quality to represent the digital game environment.

- ### Colors

     -   The primary colors...

- ### Styling

- ### Backgrounds

- ### Card images

     -   Real photos were chosen for the primary game buttons, to represent individual whale species living in their real life natural environment. This documentary feel of the game is to encourage game players to continue their education of whale song outside the game. 

- ### Audio files

     -   Real audio recordings of whale songs were chosen to facilitate the learning experience discovering the nuanced difference between whale song between various whale species. 

     -   The elegant uplifting sound effect which plays after the player presses play button is to indicate to the player that that the game is about to begin.

     -   The buzzer like game sound effect was use to clearly indicate to the player that the wrong button was selected and the game is over.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time User Goals

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Learn More" Call to action button.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image
        3. The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
        3. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
        1. Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   Title font:'FishOutOfWater'by [Font Bros](https://www.fontbros.com/) would not load after supplying to style.css the @font-face with  url for Font Bros. 
    -   Bug was squashed by adding WOFF files to Whale Song game site directory and update the css code to: 
        
        ```css

         @font-face {
            font-family: 'FishOutOfWater';
            font-weight: normal;
            font-style: normal;
            font-display: swap;
            url("/fonts/FishOutOfWater-Regular.woff") format("woff");
        }

        @font-face {
            font-family: 'FishOutOfWater';
            font-weight: bold;
            font-style: normal;
            font-display: swap;
            url("/fonts/FishOutOfWater-Bold.woff") format("woff");
        }

        @font-face {
            font-family: 'FishOutOfWaterDemiBold';
            font-weight: normal;
            font-style: normal;
            font-display: swap;
            url("/fonts/FishOutOfWater-Demibold.woff") format("woff");
        }```



-   Original whale sounds were varying length and overlapped while playing making it confusing to identify a singular whale sound unique to each whale. 
    -   Whale call raw files were edited down and audio mixed in Adobe Premiere Pro to 1-second durations to help simplify the audio playback game experience and build playback momentum.
