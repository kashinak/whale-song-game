## Design 

The game is designed to be fun and light-hearted to help engage the player in learning. The following design choices were made with this in mind: 

- ### Fonts

     -   The primary font **FishOutOfWater** was chosen for the game title because it has a fun cartoon-like water quality to fit the representation of whale's natural habitat. 

     -   The secondary font **Michroma** was chosen for the game controls, score board and game instructions because of its digital, futuristic quality to represent the digital game environment.

- ### Colors

     -   The primary colors...

- ### Styling

- ### Backgrounds

- ### Card images

     -   Real photos were chosen for the primary game buttons, to represent individual whale species living in their real life natural environment. This documentary feel of the game is to encourage game players to continue their education of whale song outside the game. 

- ### Audio files

     -   Real audio recordings of whale songs were chosen to facilitate the learning experience discovering the nuanced difference between whale song between various whale species. 

     -   The elegant uplifting sound effect which plays after the player presses play button is to indicate to the player that that the game is about to begin.

     -   The buzzer like game sound effect was use to clearly indicate to the player that the wrong button was selected and the game is over.

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   Title font:'FishOutOfWater'by [Font Bros](https://www.fontbros.com/) would not load after supplying to style.css the @font-face with  url for Font Bros. 
    -   Bug was squashed by adding WOFF files to Whale Song game site directory and update the css code to: 
        
        ```css

         @font-face {
            font-family: 'FishOutOfWater';
            font-weight: normal;
            font-style: normal;
            font-display: swap;
            url("/fonts/FishOutOfWater-Regular.woff") format("woff");
        }

        @font-face {
            font-family: 'FishOutOfWater';
            font-weight: bold;
            font-style: normal;
            font-display: swap;
            url("/fonts/FishOutOfWater-Bold.woff") format("woff");
        }

        @font-face {
            font-family: 'FishOutOfWaterDemiBold';
            font-weight: normal;
            font-style: normal;
            font-display: swap;
            url("/fonts/FishOutOfWater-Demibold.woff") format("woff");
        }```



-   Original whale sounds were varying length and overlapped while playing making it confusing to identify a singular whale sound unique to each whale. 
    -   Whale call raw files were edited down and audio mixed in Adobe Premiere Pro to 1-second durations to help simplify the audio playback game experience and build playback momentum.
